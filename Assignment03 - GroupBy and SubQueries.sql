order by net_revenue desc


-- Q4.
-- Find the average list price of products in each category.
-- Show category_id and avg_price (rounded to 2 decimal places).

GROUP BY s.first_name, s.last_name
ORDER BY order_count DESC;

-- Q15. (BONUS — Multi-concept)
-- Find customers who have spent more than $10,000 in total.
-- Join sales.customers → sales.orders → sales.order_items.
-- Show customer full name as customer_name and total_spent.
-- Sort by total_spent descending.
-- (Hint: JOIN + GROUP BY + HAVING)
SELECT 
    (c.first_name + ' ' + c.last_name) AS customer_name,
    SUM(oi.quantity * oi.list_price * (1 - oi.discount)) AS total_spent
FROM sales.customers c
JOIN sales.orders o
    ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
JOIN sales.order_items oi
    ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
GROUP BY c.first_name, c.last_name
HAVING SUM(oi.quantity * oi.list_price * (1 - oi.discount)) > 10000
